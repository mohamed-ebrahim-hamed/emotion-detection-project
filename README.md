# Emotion Detection Project

## Overview

This is an emotion detection project built with Python (Flask backend) and JavaScript (frontend). The application analyzes audio or text input to detect emotions using machine learning models.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection from audio input
- User-friendly web interface
- Support for multiple emotion categories
- Integration with pre-trained models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed-ebrahim-hamed/emotion-detection-project.git
   cd emotion-detection-project
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models from the following links:
   - [Model 1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BiVjgp9NKe4rI5ZBAV4m6FEWCLneQ-ob?usp=drive_link)
   - [Model 2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NNbntFG6XvTstb0xDGsqsngWKdLIzzaW?usp=drive_link)

   Place the models in the appropriate directory (e.g., `models/`).

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

## Usage

- Upload an audio file or input text.
- The application will analyze and display the detected emotions.
